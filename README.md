# CDSS4PCP
This repository contains code for the CDSS4PCP modules project.
The goal is to develop and share ready-to-distribute clinical decision support (CDS) module for OpenMRS [an open-source electronic medical record (EMR) system], an enhanced CDS module for OpenEMR (another open-source EMR system). They will generate educational modules on CDS and its work mechanisms. The CDS modules, which will include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended immunization schedules, can reach broader and existing user communities of OpenMRS and OpenEMR and potentially change clinical care delivered via these systems and enhance patient populations served by these systems. The educational modules will help better train the future healthcare information technology workforce, especially on CDS.
